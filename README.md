Looking for the LeaderPivot Blazor control? This repo is not it.  Please [check here for the Blazor control](https://github.com/leaderanalytics/LeaderPivot.Blazor), and [here for the demo project](https://github.com/leaderanalytics/LeaderPivot.BlazorDemo).



Thinking about writing a pivot table control for a specific UI?  This repo is a great place to start.  LeaderPivot is a base library that creates a data structure which can be used to render a pivot table.  This library contains the logic and the low level components that are used to create the pivot table data structure.  It also contains methods that can be used to hand UI events such as collapsing/expanding nodes or rearranging dimensions.  Currently, one UI specific implementation exists for [Blazor](https://github.com/leaderanalytics/LeaderPivot.Blazor).


## Classes

* `Measure` - Describes a column or variable to be used as a datapoint on a pivot table.
* `Dimension` - Describes how data should be grouped.  Used to represent an axis on a multi-dimensional pivot table.
* `Node` - Intermediate data structure produced by `NodeBuilder` as a result of grouping data.
* `Matrix` - Tabular data structure generated by `MatrixBuilder`.  
* `NodeBuilder` - Groups data based on the supplied `Dimensions`. Constructs a hierarchical `Node` structure which is then passed to `MatrixBuilder`.
* `MatrixBuilder` - Traverses the `Node` structure produced by `NodeBuilder` and produces a `Matrix` consisting of `MatrixCell` objects. `MatrixCell` exposes properties the UI layer will use to render a pivot table.
